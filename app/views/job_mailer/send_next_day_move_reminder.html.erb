  <p>Ready for upcoming move? Donâ€™t worry, Brave Movers Team have you covered.

  <p>Hello <%= @customer.first_name %>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    We are excited to see you tomorrow. Our team will call you and will confirm arrival time. Please let us know if
    there are any important information we need to know, for example: I have a little baby, so do not knock or ring
    doorbell, or any special parking requirements, or bring extra packing supplies because I will probably need help to
    finish my packing, etc.
    This information is very important for us as we want to provide the best moving experience.

  </p>

  <p>
    Please call, text or send us an email if any questions or suggestions.
